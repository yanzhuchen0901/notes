### 段二
能力类作文的一种通用思路：能力不仅是一种被动的品质，更是一种主动的力量帮助我们更好的面对失败
translation：
    Risk resilience is not merely about enduring challenges passively;it is about mastering the art ofadaptation and the capacity to recover swiftly from setbacks

那么方法段怎么写呢？
1. 通过使用反面推至极端的办法，详见上一篇
2. 通过列举，一点一点地指出具体的方案
3. 举例子作证

或者通过多合一（保底思路）：
    Risk resilience is not merely about enduring challenges passively; it is about mastering the `art` of adaptation and the capacity to recover swiftly from setbacks. It requires a delicate balance of `emotional regulation`,`cognitive flexibility`, a strong belief in one'sability to learn from failure. **Take Steve Jobs as an example, who faced constant setbacks on hisjourney to success. After being ousted from Apple, he didn't give up. Instead, he regulated hisemotions, reassessed the lessons from his failure, and with greater cognitive flexibility went on tofound NeXT and Pixar**.This process truly `exemplify` emotional regulation,cognitive flexibility, astrong belief in one's ability to learn from failure.

### 段三
最后怎么写？
从企业家回到我们学生：
    Moreover, developing risk resilience necessitates a fundamental shift in perspective. It demandsthat students not only tolerate uncertainty but embrace it an essential component of their personal and intellectual development.

诗意一点的方法？
    A truly resilient person is not one who avoids failure, but one who confronts it with grace,extracts wisdom from it, and rises with even greater purpose. True strength,therefore, is not about avoiding the storm, but about mastering the art of dancing inthe rain-becoming not just a survivor, but a master of transformation in the face ofadversity.
